Submission to Global PyTorch Summer Hackathon! #PTSH19

It’s well known that Facebook can infer much of us from our social media activity. Yet much of us don’t react to everything we see.
I propose to create a machine learning model that takes a picture of our face while we are on social media so it can better understand how we feel even when we don't engage with the platform
